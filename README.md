This project delves into the fascinating intersection of ornithology and digital signal processing, where the goal is to automate the classification of bird syllables.  The research is motivated by the desire to streamline the process of analyzing bird vocalizations, which is crucial for understanding avian behavior, evolution, and socialization.  

The project aims to develop and assess the robustness of various methods for determining the similarity between bird syllables.  The primary challenge lies in accounting for the dynamic nature of bird syllables, which are non-stationary signals that can exhibit variations in tempo and frequency.  

To address this challenge, the project employs three distinct similarity measures: Spectrogram Cross-Correlation (SPCC), Wavelet Transform Cross-Correlation (WTCC), and a feature extraction method based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).  These methods are evaluated based on their ability to accurately classify pairs of syllables as similar or dissimilar, taking into account the potential for noise and natural variations in bird vocalizations.

The image below is a visual sketch of the developed SPCC algorithm:
